class Package:
    """
    A class representing a package in robot data communication.
    
    This class is designed to parse and manage the information contained
    within a package received from a Universal Robots' e-series cobot. It
    deserializes the package's robot data, extracts the package type, and
    processes its subpackages. 

    Attributes:
        length (int): The length of the package.
        type (int): The type of the package.
        robot_data (str): A hexadecimal string representing binary data with
                          robot parameters encoded as packages and subpackages.
        subpackage_list (list): A list containing the processed subpackage objects.
        received_timestamp (datetime): A timestamp representing when the package was received.

    Methods:
        get_package_length: Extract the package length from the given robot data.
        get_package_type: Extract the package type from the given robot data.
        read_subpackages: Deserialize and process subpackages within the robot data.
        get_subpackage: Retrieve a specific subpackage from the subpackage list by name.
        __str__: Generate a report for the package object, including its subpackages.
